## Topic: Collision/Obstacle Avoidance Based on Vision  

### Abstract
First, we will create a unified modular development environment that implements the basic [Reynolds model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) for bird flocking. Next, we will enhance the flocking algorithms to make them more realistic. We will draw on findings from [Flock2: A Model for Orientation-Based Social Flocking](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519324001644?via%3Dihub#b58) and [A Model of Collective Behavior Based Purely on Vision](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aay0792) to develop a more authentic flocking behavior. In the third part, we will either incorporate collision and obstacle avoidance systems using [The Emergence of Collective Obstacle Avoidance Based on a Visual Perception Mechanism](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0020025521010537?via%3Dihub) or adapt the entire project to work in 3D.

### Milestones:
- First report (November 16th): review and implementation of existing models (Reynolds), outlined ideas for improved models/methods
- Second report (December 7th): adding more realistic vision based flocking behaviour to the agents in the baseline model
- Third report (January 11th): adding intelligent group behaviour to the baseline model (e.g. genetic algorithm, reinforced learning), maybe creating a 3d visualization, evaluation of implemented models, final conclusions and presentation
