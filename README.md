## Topic: Collision/Obstacle Avoidance Based on Vision  




### Abstract
First, we will create a unified modular development environment that implements the basic [Reynolds model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) for bird flocking. Next, we will enhance the flocking algorithms to make them more realistic. We will draw on findings from [Flock2: A Model for Orientation-Based Social Flocking](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519324001644?via%3Dihub#b58) and [A Model of Collective Behavior Based Purely on Vision](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aay0792) to develop a more authentic flocking behavior. Finally, we will compare the implemented models with the baseline model and examine the impact of different field of view parameters on the flock's behaviour. 




### Milestones:
- First report (November 16th): review and implementation of existing models (Reynolds), outlined ideas for improved models/methods
- Second report (December 7th): adding more realistic vision based flocking behaviour to the agents in the baseline model
- Third report (January 11th): evaluation of implemented models and comparison with the baseline model, final conclusions and presentation (possibly 3D)
