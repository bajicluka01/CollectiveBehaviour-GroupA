## Topic: Simulation of group behaviour during a protest




### Abstract
First, we will create a unified modular development environment that implements the basic flocking model [Reynolds model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids), to which we will add obstacle avoidance and place it in a topological map of Ljubljana (or any city in general). Afterwards we will divide agents into different groups (e.g. leader, regular protest member, bypasser) and create different behaviour patterns for each group based on [psychology](https://repozitorij.uni-lj.si/IzpisGradiva.php?id=66052). Finally we will add agents for crowd control (e.g. police) and examine the effect they have on the crowd. 




### Milestones:
- First report (November 16th): review and implementation of existing models (Reynolds), outlined ideas for improved models/methods
- Second report (December 7th): adding more realistic vision based flocking behaviour to the agents in the baseline model
- Third report (January 11th): evaluation of implemented models and comparison with the baseline model, final conclusions and presentation (possibly 3D)
