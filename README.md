## Topic: Simulation of group behaviour during a protest




### Abstract
First, we will create a unified modular development environment that implements the basic flocking model [Reynolds model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids), to which we will add obstacle avoidance and place it in a topological map of Ljubljana (or any city in general). Afterwards we will divide agents into [different groups](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281938638_Agent-Based_modeling_of_protests_and_violent_confrontation_a_micro-situational_multi-player_contextual_rule-based_approach) (e.g. leader, regular protest member, bypasser) and create different behaviour patterns for each group based on [psychology](https://repozitorij.uni-lj.si/IzpisGradiva.php?id=66052). Finally we will add agents for crowd control (e.g. police) and examine the effect they have on the crowd. 




### Milestones:
- First report (November 16th): review and implementation of existing models (Reynolds), create topological map
- Second report (December 7th): adding more realistic vision based flocking behaviour to the agents in the baseline model
- Third report (January 11th): evaluation of implemented models and comparison with the baseline model, final conclusions and presentation (possibly 3D)
