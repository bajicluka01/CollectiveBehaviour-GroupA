## Topic: Simulation of group behaviour during a protest



### Abstract

The purpose of our project is to study the behavior of a crowd during a protest. In order to so, we will first create a unified modular development environment that implements the basic flocking model. 

Then we will add obstacle avoidance and place the model in a topological map of Ljubljana. Furthermore, we will divide agents into [different groups](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281938638_Agent-Based_modeling_of_protests_and_violent_confrontation_a_micro-situational_multi-player_contextual_rule-based_approach) (e.g. leader, regular protest member and bypasser) and create different behavioural patterns for each group based on [group psychology](https://repozitorij.uni-lj.si/IzpisGradiva.php?id=66052). 

Finally, we will add agents for [crowd control](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347869556_Testing_Various_Riot_Control_Police_Formations_through_Agent-Based_Modeling_and_Simulation) (e.g. police) and examine the effect they have on the behaviour of the crowd. 

**Optional**: we will attempt to optimize police behaviour with methods such as genetic algorithms (the purpose being crowd dispersal or redirection).
