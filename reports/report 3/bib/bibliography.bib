abstract = {Riots originating during, or in the aftermath of, sports events can incur significant costs in damages, as well as large-scale panic and injuries. A mathematical description of sports riots is therefore sought to better understand their propagation and limit these physical and financial damages. In this work, we present an agent-based modelling (ABM) framework that describes the qualitative features of populations engaging in riotous behaviour. Agents, pertaining to either a ‘rioter’ or a ‘bystander’ sub-population, move on an underlying lattice and can either be recruited or defect from their respective sub-population. In particular, we allow these individual-level recruitment and defection processes to vary with local population density. This agent-based modelling framework provides the unifying link between multi-population stochastic models and density-dependent reaction processes. Furthermore, the continuum description of this ABM framework is shown to be a system of nonlinear reaction–diffusion equations and faithfully agrees with the average ABM behaviour from individual simulations. Finally, we determine the unique correspondence between the underlying individual-level recruitment and defection mechanisms with their population-level counterparts, providing a link between local-scale effects and macroscale rioting phenomena.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the realism of a rule-based crowd simulation model by incorporating social rules and gaze-driven attention with consistent animations. Current crowd simulation models focus mostly on steering towards a goal while avoiding collision based on the agent’s direction of movement. This leads to robot-like simulations since agents’ appear to always have their attention perfectly aligned with the direction of movement. In the real world we observe that humans move in a crowd performing collision avoidance driven by attention, gaze, and non-verbal coordination with incoming traffic. In addition, humans exhibit different steering strategies based on whether they walk alone or in a group, whether they can look ahead and plan their best local movement, or react more abruptly because their gaze diverts from their direction of movement. Human gaze can be driven by movement but also by distractions such as being engaged in conversation with other people or using mobile phones. These human features are overlooked in crowd simulation leading often to perfectly smooth local movements of individuals. Our proposed method enhances existing crowd simulation frameworks by integrating social behavior models that affect both individual and collective dynamics, and drives gaze behavior to better simulate attention. By applying these models at both the steering and animation levels, we significantly improve the realism of the crowd simulation. A user study shows that our model was perceived as being more realistic and consistent with social behaviors when compared to a more traditional collision avoidance with just locomotion or with random animations.},
